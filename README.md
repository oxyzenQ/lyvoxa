# ðŸ¦€ Rust System Monitor

A high-performance, low-memory system monitor written in Rust, designed to be a fast alternative to htop with beautiful terminal UI.

## Features

- **Real-time CPU monitoring** with usage graphs
- **Memory usage tracking** with visual indicators
- **Process listing** sorted by CPU usage
- **Low memory footprint** - built with Rust for optimal performance
- **Fast updates** - minimal latency system monitoring
- **Beautiful TUI** - modern terminal interface using ratatui
- **Cross-platform** - works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Installation & Usage

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd rust-monitor

# Build the release version for optimal performance
cargo build --release

# Run the full TUI version (htop-like interface)
./target/release/rust-monitor

# Or run the simple terminal version
./target/release/simple-monitor
```

### Controls

**Full TUI Version:**
- `q` - Quit the application
- `Esc` - Exit the application

**Simple Version:**
- `Ctrl+C` - Exit the application

## Performance Benefits

This Rust-based monitor offers several advantages over traditional system monitors:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety without garbage collection
2. **Low CPU Overhead**: Compiled binary with optimized system calls
3. **Fast Startup**: No interpreter or virtual machine overhead
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Self-contained binary with minimal runtime requirements

## Architecture

The project is structured into two main components:

- `src/main.rs` - Full TUI interface with graphs and interactive elements
- `src/simple.rs` - Lightweight terminal output for minimal resource usage
- `src/monitor.rs` - Core system monitoring logic using the `sysinfo` crate

## Dependencies

- `sysinfo` - Cross-platform system information gathering
- `ratatui` - Terminal user interface framework
- `crossterm` - Cross-platform terminal manipulation
- `tokio` - Async runtime for responsive UI
- `humansize` - Human-readable size formatting

## Comparison with htop

| Feature | htop | rust-monitor |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Memory Usage | ~2-4 MB | ~1-2 MB |
| CPU Overhead | Medium | Low |
| Startup Time | Fast | Very Fast |
| Language | C | Rust |
| Safety | Manual memory management | Memory safe |

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Network monitoring
- [ ] Disk I/O statistics
- [ ] Process tree view
- [ ] Configuration file support
- [ ] Custom color themes
- [ ] Process filtering and search
- [ ] Export monitoring data
